Internet publishing platform for LHVM-based interactive programs

## What does this do?
LHAPI allows LHVM-powered clients to publish their programs to the web.

Once published, people can run your LHVM-powered program in an HTML visualizer,
viewable anywhere a web browser will run.

## Why would you want to hack on this?
* Custom WebGL visualizers
* Add scripting hooks and workflow to your LHVM programs
* Make your LHVM programs sampleable over the web
* Add additional technical capabilities, such as socket streams
* Integrate with other web services
